# LSTM-Stock-Price-Prediction-Example
Implementing LSTM for time series data
As stock price data is relatively easy to obtain, it is used as an example in this project. However, an obvious bias is that the LSTM will overfit and use previous day's data as a prediction. Nevertheless, it may be useful for analysis of other types of time series using LSTM.
