# LSTM-Stock-Price-Prediction-Example
As stock price data is relatively easy to obtain, it is used as an example in this project. However, an obvious bias is that the LSTM will overfit and use previous day's data as a prediction. Nevertheless, the focus of this project is to explore and provide a guide for reshaping different input types for LSTM as it may be useful for analysis of other types of time series data.
